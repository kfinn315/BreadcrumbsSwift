Maps and Tracks App for iOS

This project's purpose is to create a basic route tracking application for iOS, using Swift.  I am using it as an exercise to learn Swift and basic iOS features like CoreData, CloudKit, MapKit, CoreLocation, etc.  I also think it will be a fun app!

Currently, the application saves locations to CoreData and completed routes to CloudKit, where they can be retrieved by the app.  To begin with, all saved routes can be viewed by everybody and there is no way to delete routes inside the application.  Routes can't be edited either.  These features will be my next step.

Eventually, I would like to have an application that is a record of one's walks, hikes, runs, bikerides, roadtrip, etc.  I would like it to be simple, intuitive, but with more advanced options.
