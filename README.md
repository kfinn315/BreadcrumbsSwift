Maps and Tracks App for iOS

This project's purpose is to create a basic route tracking application for iOS, using Swift.  I am using it as an exercise to improve my skills with Swift and iOS native libraries like CoreData, CloudKit, MapKit, CoreLocation, ALAssetsLibrary and third-party libraries like RxSwift, Eureka.

Eventually, I would like to have an application that is a record of one's walks, hikes, runs, bikerides, roadtrip, etc.  I would like it to be simple, intuitive, but with more advanced options for more refined users.
